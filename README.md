# build-webpage-project

"Welcome. I create this as a demonstration on how Python can be use with Docker
to generate a webpage."

The Python script was written to save effort creating containers to host a webpage and
to save effort generating basic web content.

I hope this project is useful to start making web content at scale!

# Requirement

# Python Steps
Step 1. Prompt user to create a webpage

Step 2. Based on the the input
